# LoreQuestConcept
 A real time battle system for a game I'm developing: LoreQuest, an experimental, real-world RPG. The base classes for items, players, and enemies are complete. The goal is to create a rich, immersive experience that will encourage players to explore parts of their communities they donâ€™t usually think to look by leveraging data of the users walking habbits.
